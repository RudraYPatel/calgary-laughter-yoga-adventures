            Well, hello there! </p>
            <p className='mb-4 gap-10'>We are Calgary Laughter Yoga, an inclusive group of folks from different walks of life with a passion for laughter and wellbeing. We want to ensure you feel welcome here and connect with our vibe!Â </p>
            <p className='mb-4 gap-10'>Our club has been running since 2013 in various spaces around Calgary. We started when three of us met at a laughter conference in Vancouver. Knowing that we all bring different strengths to the team, with a shared vision for joy, health and community, we joined forces and are building something stronger and better together than what we could have done on our own.

Our favourite venue is the <a href="https://www.insideouttheatre.com/" target="_blank" class="underline">Inside Out Theatre</a> as it aligns with our values and is a fabulous space in the heart of downtown. You may find us around the city filling other spaces with joy and laughter as well!
